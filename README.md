# CryptoPals-writeups
my solutions for the cryptopals challenges at cryptopals.com

please note the writeup for the second set still requires a bit of work, since after completing it i have decided
to switch from using the pycrypto package to using the cryptography package since in the latter the algorithms are implemented
low-level hence it should be faster. I haven't finished the switch yet but the writeup should still hold with minor changes.
